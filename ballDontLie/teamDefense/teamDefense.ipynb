    "# Team defensive schemes\n",
    "Does a team's defensive scheme influence opponents' shot portfolios? \n",
    "I'm going to be using [a different NBA API](https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper) to query all the games for the 2018-2019 regular season.\n",
    "In each game, I'm going to log each \"make\" against a team's defense.\n",
    "For example, Houston makes a 22-ft 3-point shot against Boston, I will log the distance at which Houston scored against Boston.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to be presenting this as a matrix within a pandas DataFrame, where each row is the defensive team, each column is the offensive team, and each entry is a list of distances for every successful make (excluding free throws).\n",
    "Conveniently, if you look across a row, you'll be examining that team's defense against all other teams.\n",
    "Conversely, if you look down a column, you'll be examiniing that team's offense against all other teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some caveats to this analysis:\n",
    "* There are some errors to some game logs, but there are only a few, and those will have a negligible influence since each team plays 82 games anyways. \n",
    "* Player injuries may influence a team's defensive/offensive play, but hopefully the team's tactics still hold. \n",
    "* The game logs themselves may log each team's acctions \"messily\". If you look at the code, the logic to classify a make involves finding the word 'make' and not finding the word 'free throw'. On top of that, I'm doing some very rudimentary parsing to find the distance of each make. \n",
    "* Maybe I ought to normalize for pace or opposing team's \"average\" offensive skill/behavior, but just histogramming the counts of each make should hopefully be enough to get a sense of a defensive team's allowed-shot portfolio.\n",
    "* Because we're only looking at \"makes\", a blocked shot and missed shot are both equally neglected when detecing \"makes\", although, in reality, a blocked shot could say more about the defender while a missed shot might say more about the shooter."
